### Overview

This is an app that calls three different news APIs: Reddit, NewsAPI, and HackerNews.

These each have three hardcoded search terms or categories: 'Burgers', 'New & Popular', and 'Sports' respectively.

The app will dynamically update the latest stories and allow the user to view a small sample of the indivdual stories in a pop-up. 

The user can also click on a link for the full story.

Please feel free to dowload; but, note you will need to acquire your own API keys.
